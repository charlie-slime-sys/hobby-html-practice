    <h1>The Delve Into Art</h1>
<p>In the entirety of my life, art has always had my attention. Art can come in many, <em>many</em> different forms.</p>
<p>Art can be music, drawing, acting, and many other things.</p>
<p>Personally, I am into <strong>music</strong> and <strong>drawing</strong>.</p>

<h2> What Can Art Benefit?</h2>
<p>Art can benefit various factors:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Mental Health</strong>: Art and music are types of therapy. They can improve the mental state and cognitive skill for your imagination.</li>
    <li><strong>Imagination</strong>: Imagination is boosted through how one views things. Translating interpretation into something <em>visual</em> can make someone's theoretical skills improved, therefore letting out someone's enclosed thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<p>These factors can also improve someone's work ethic. As making something fun - i.e. art - can provide motivation for other things. For example, math, or writing.</p>
<h3>Ways To Improve Art, Even If You're "Bad" At It.</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Practice <em>EVERY</em> day, with any supplies you have. If you run out of motivation, put it down. It'll burn you out if you continue.</li>
<li>Upgrade your materials. For traditional art, try to avoid starter kits and resort to buying <em>specific</em> supplies. <em>This can also go the same way with musicianship.</em></li>
<li>Experiment with style. If you never do this, you'll never know your capabilities with art, in any form.</li>
<li>Along with style experimentation, experiment with <strong>technique</strong>. Technique will improve your style.</li>
<li>Move out of simplicity. Practicing one thing over and over in technique never fully tests the technique. For instance, with art, if your style is cartoony or anime-esc, try realism. It will improve your skill with proportions.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this information, it should be easy to become an intermediate artist of any kind. I encourage passion and effort into everything you do.</p>
